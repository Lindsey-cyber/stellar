# All Fixes Applied - Ready to Test!

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. Wallet Connection Fixed
**Problem:** Wallet connection wasn't working
**Solution:**
- Fixed `connect()` function to properly call Freighter API
- Added Freighter detection
- Better error handling with clear messages
- Debug mode enabled

### 2. TrancheType Enum Encoding Fixed
**Problem:** Contract enum wasn't being properly encoded for Soroban
**Solution:**
- Changed from simple Symbol to Vec[Symbol, Vec[]] format
- This matches how Soroban encodes C-style enums (variants without data)
- Format: `Vec[Symbol("Senior"), Vec[]]` or `Vec[Symbol("Junior"), Vec[]]`

### 3. Read-Only Contract Calls Fixed
**Problem:** getTotals(), getMinimums(), isPaused() needed real account
**Solution:**
- Use fake Account object for simulation (allowed for read-only calls)
- No need to fetch account from network
- Simulations work instantly

## üìù What Was Changed

### Files Modified:

1. **[contexts/WalletContext.tsx](contexts/WalletContext.tsx)**
   - Fixed `connect()` to properly handle Freighter responses
   - Added Freighter detection
   - Fixed `getAccountBalance()` to accept address parameter
   - Better debug logging

2. **[utils/trancheHelpers.ts](utils/trancheHelpers.ts)**
   - Fixed `trancheTypeToScVal()` - now encodes as `Vec[Symbol, Vec[]]`
   - Fixed `getTotals()` - uses fake Account for simulation
   - Fixed `getMinimums()` - uses fake Account for simulation
   - Fixed `isPaused()` - uses fake Account for simulation
   - Added `Account` import from stellar-sdk

3. **[.env.local](.env.local)** (created)
   - Enabled DEBUG mode
   - Set Horizon URL

## üöÄ How to Test

### Prerequisites:
1. ‚úÖ Freighter wallet installed
2. ‚úÖ Freighter unlocked
3. ‚úÖ On Stellar Testnet
4. ‚úÖ Have testnet XLM (from friendbot)
5. ‚úÖ Dev server running on http://localhost:3000

### Test Steps:

#### Step 1: Test Wallet Connection
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Scroll to "Real Tranche Contract Integration" section
4. Click "Connect Wallet"
5. **Expected:**
   - Console shows `[Wallet] Requesting access...`
   - Freighter popup appears
   - After approving: `[Wallet] Successfully connected: GXXX...`
   - Your address and balance appear in UI

#### Step 2: Test Data Loading
1. After connection, watch the TrancheInvestment component
2. **Expected:**
   - Senior tranche card shows your share, total, and minimum
   - Junior tranche card shows your share, total, and minimum
   - All values load (may be 0 if contract is new)

#### Step 3: Test Subscribe (Investment)
1. Select "Senior Tranche" or "Junior Tranche"
2. Enter an amount (above minimum)
3. Click "Subscribe"
4. **Expected:**
   - Loading indicator appears
   - Freighter popup for transaction signing
   - After signing: Transaction success message
   - Transaction hash displayed with link to Stellar Expert
   - Your share updates automatically

#### Step 4: Test Redeem (Withdrawal)
1. If you have a balance, enter an amount
2. Click "Redeem"
3. **Expected:**
   - Same flow as subscribe
   - Tokens returned to your wallet
   - Balance updates

## üêõ Debug Console Output

When everything works correctly, you should see:

```javascript
// Connection
[Wallet] Requesting access...
[Wallet] requestAccess response: { error: null }
[Wallet] getAddress response: { error: null, address: "GXXX..." }
[Wallet] Successfully connected: GXXX...

// Transaction
[Wallet] freighter sign -> { signedTxXdr: "..." }
```

## üîß Contract Details

**Contract Address:** `CAIUMAVGQUDLA5EMTCC4GY5EF64VMZOFPSS6EFZZKLFWMAB56ZPE5QRP`

**Available Functions:**
- `subscribe(from, tranche, amount)` - Invest in Senior/Junior tranche
- `redeem(from, tranche, amount)` - Withdraw from tranche
- `get_user_share(user, tranche)` - Get user's current balance
- `get_totals()` - Get total invested in both tranches
- `get_minimums()` - Get minimum investment requirements
- `is_paused()` - Check if contract is paused

**Admin Functions** (not in UI yet):
- `set_paused(admin, paused)` - Pause/unpause contract
- `set_minimums(admin, min_senior, min_junior)` - Update minimums
- `notify_pool_payout(admin, amount)` - Distribute profits
- `apply_loss(admin, loss_amount)` - Apply losses (waterfall)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues

### "Freighter wallet not detected"
- Install Freighter: https://www.freighter.app/
- Refresh page after installing

### "Failed to connect. Make sure Freighter is unlocked"
- Click Freighter icon in browser
- Enter password to unlock

### Enum Encoding Error
- Fixed! The enum is now properly encoded as `Vec[Symbol("Senior"), Vec[]]`

### Simulation Failed
- Make sure contract is initialized
- Check contract address is correct
- Verify you're on testnet

## üìä What The Contract Does

Based on your Rust code:

1. **Subscribe**: Transfers tokens from you to contract, records your investment
2. **Redeem**: Transfers tokens from contract back to you
3. **Waterfall Structure**:
   - Junior tranche absorbs losses first
   - Senior is protected until Junior is wiped out
4. **Profit Distribution**: Both tranches get proportional share

## üéØ Next Features To Add

1. **Admin Panel** - For notify_pool_payout and apply_loss
2. **Transaction History** - Show past investments/withdrawals
3. **Charts** - Visualize tranche distribution
4. **APY Calculator** - Show potential returns
5. **Events Display** - Show recent contract events

## ‚úÖ Ready to Test!

Everything is fixed and ready! Open http://localhost:3000 and try:
1. Connect wallet
2. View tranche data
3. Subscribe to a tranche
4. Redeem from a tranche

The contract at `CAIUMAVGQUDLA5EMTCC4GY5EF64VMZOFPSS6EFZZKLFWMAB56ZPE5QRP` is live on testnet and fully integrated! üöÄ

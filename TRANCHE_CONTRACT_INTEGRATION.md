## Contract Functions Overview

Based on your Rust contract, here's what each function does:

### `subscribe(from, tranche, amount)`
- **Purpose:** Invest tokens into Senior or Junior tranche
- **What it does:**
  - Transfers tokens from your wallet to the contract
  - Records your investment in the tranche mapping
  - Updates total invested amount
  - Checks minimum investment requirement

### `redeem(from, tranche, amount)`
- **Purpose:** Withdraw your invested tokens
- **What it does:**
  - Checks you have enough balance
  - Transfers tokens from contract back to you
  - Updates your recorded balance
  - Updates total invested amount

- **Returns:** (senior_total, junior_total)

### `get_minimums()`
- **Purpose:** Check minimum investment requirements
- **Returns:** (min_senior, min_junior)

## Waterfall Structure

Your contract implements a waterfall payment structure:

1. **Junior Tranche absorbs losses first:**
   - When `apply_loss()` is called, Junior investors lose money first
   - Only after Junior is wiped out does Senior take losses

2. **Payouts via `notify_pool_payout()`:**
   - Profits are distributed proportionally to investments
   - Both Senior and Junior get their share based on amounts invested
